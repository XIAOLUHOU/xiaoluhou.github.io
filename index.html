        title="When it comes to side-channel countermeasures, software encoding schemes are becoming popular and provide a good level of security for generalpurpose microcontrollers. However, these schemes are not designed to be fault resistant, and this property is discussed very rarely. Therefore, implementers have to pile up two different countermeasures in order to protect the algorithm against these two popular classes of attacks. In our paper, we discuss the fault resistance properties of encoding schemes in general. We define theoretical bounds that clearly show the possibilities and limitations of encoding-based countermeasures, together with trade-offs between side-channel and fault resistance. Moreover, we simulate several codes with respect to most popular fault models, using a general-purpose microcontroller assembly implementation. Our algorithm shows how to implement fault resistance to an encoding scheme that currently has the best side-channel resistant capabilities. As a result, we are able to design a code by using automated methods, that can provide the optimal trade-off between side-channel and fault resistance.">

We propose a generic construction with explicit generator and Gram matrices, then focus on modular and unimodular lattices, obtained in the particular cases of totally real, respectively, imaginary, quadratic fields. Our motivation comes from coding theory, thus some relevant properties of modular lattices, such as minimal norm, theta series, kissing number and secrecy gain are analyzed. Interesting lattices are exhibited. (Click for PDF)">

        title=". Fault injection attack models are normally determined by analyzing the cipher structure and finding exploitable spots in non-linear and diffusion layers. However, this level of abstraction is often too high to distinguish vulnerable parts of software implementations, due to specific operations and optimizations. On the other hand, manually analyzing the assembly code requires non-negligible amount of time and expertise. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for analyzing cipher
implementations in assembly. We represent the whole assembly program as a graph, allowing us to find vulnerable spots efficiently. Fault propagation is analyzed in a subgraph constructed from each vulnerable spot, allowing us to automatically generate equations for differential fault analysis. We have created a tool that implements our approach: ATLAS – Automated TooL for Assembly analysiS. We have successfully used this tool for attacking PRESENT-80, being able to find implementation-specific vulnerabilities that can be exploited in order to recover the secret key with 16 faults. Our results show that ATLAS is useful in finding attack spots that are not visible from the cipher structure, but can be easily exploited when dealing with real-world implementations.

        title="An Arakelov-modular lattice of level l,where is a positive integer,is anl−modular lattice constructed from a fractional ideal of a CM field such that the lattice can be obtained from its dual by multiplication of an element with absolute value l. The characterization of existence of Arakelov-modular lattices has been completed for cyclotomic fields. In this paper, we extend the definition to totally real number fields and study the criteria for the existence of Arakelov-modular lattices over totally real number fields and CM fields. We give the characterization of Arakelov- modular lattices over the maximal real subfield of a cyclotomic field with prime power degree and totally real Galois fields with odd degrees. Characterizations of Arakelov-modular lattices of trace type, which are special cases of Arakelov-modular lattices, are given for quadratic fields and maximal real subfields of cyclotomic fields with non-prime power degrees.
